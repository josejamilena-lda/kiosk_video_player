/**
 * @file theme_template.css
 *
 * Write some CSS here.
 * Define backgrounds, text styles, colors, thumbnail sizing, spacing, etc.
 *
 * If you're using any files, like a background image or an @font-face defined font,
 * those should be saved in assets/themes/your-project-name.
 *
 * This stylesheet will be included on all kiosks within the project. If you need to
 * override a project style for a specific component, use the body class with your
 * sub-theme name, which is added to the DOM by video_kiosk.js.
 *
 * When you're done here, rename the file to something project-specific, and remove
 * this comment block.
